Description: An implementation of the Bayesdian hierarchical models for combining estimates from multiple studies or domains. 
        When only summary estimates are avaiable, univariate model is used. 
        When given corresponding measures of the uncertainty of each estimate is also avaiable, we can further use the bivariate model. Such a model should take into account the uncertainty of the estimates as well as the uncertainty in the measures of the uncertainty, in addition to the association between these quantities.
        See ``Bivariate Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Combining Summary Measures from Multiple Sources'' for more information.
